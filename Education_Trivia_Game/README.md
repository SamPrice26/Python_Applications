This project is about creating a fun and interactive learning game for students who may not be able to attend class due to mental health constraints. It takes the form of a multiple-choice trivia game that covers various curriculum topics for primary school children. It incorporates the use of media to create variation, a sense of enjoyment and achievement through promoting positive engagement to boost the well-being of young people.

### Game Rules üì≤üéÆ
The console app retrieves data about different educational trivia questions, including their subject name and id, difficulty level and an array of the correct and incorrect answer choices. 

Students will be able to select their subject choice from the current subjects provided: *English* and *Math*, and then select their difficulty level from the options 'easy', 'medium', 'hard' or 'any'. A set of 10 questions for their selected choice of subject and difficulty level will then be generated, and each question has a 30 second timer within which the student will need to provide an answer *A, B, C* or *D*.

Student answers are recorded in a file for the student to be able to track their progress in the app at the end of each question set for further review. At the end of the game, students can see their total score in the console. Points are awarded for correct answers based on the difficulty level and the time taken to answer, whilst incorrect answers gain no points and instead feedback is given on the correct answer. Below is a demonstration of the score key:
```
Easy: 1-5 points
Medium: 3-7 points
Hard: 5-10 points
```
Students can earn achievements for completing subjects, reaching score milestones or for their answering streaks.
### User Features üßë‚Äçüíªü§ìüìñ
The Educational Trivia Game app is designed for use from students, teachers, parents and administration. The user functions provided for each type of user are outlined below:

### Instructions for Creating User Account ü§ñüñ•Ô∏è
The user is prompted for their user type (student, parent or teacher), after which they are prompted for a username, email address and a password. The user is then presented a menu based on their user type.

### Instructions for Creating Quizzes üìù‚úçÔ∏è
Only the user tpye of 'teacher' has access to create and update quizzes. Currently, the quizzes are in the form of a `quizzes` table linking to a `quiz_questions` table with subject-specific questions. The teacher user can select on the 'Create new quiz' option in the teacher menu. They will then be prompted to enter a quiz name eg *Easy English*, and a new quiz will be added to the `quizzes` table in the `trivia_questions` database. The teacher can then add/delete questions in that quiz.

- test_game.py
- test_main.py
- test_questions.py
- test_user.py

The tests were created using unittests in PyCharm, and are still undergoing further debugging and improvement.
